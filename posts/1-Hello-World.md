Hello! I'm trying to write some stuff for my blog. Currently it's September 8th, 2024, 6:42pm EST. I have to run 16k soon and I'm not too excited about that. I know I'll be able to do it but it's still that mental block of: "Do I want to?". Well 100% I don't have to. So why do I want to run 16k nevertheless a marathon...

Well in all fairness, I've already talked the talk. I remember watching this Instagram reel where some guy talked about that happy feeling of telling everyone you're running a marathon. You feel like a superstar and everyone is so proud of you. But now you're here and you actually have to do it, way different story. You don't want to let anyone down now. People are rooting for you and now it's more than just about you. That's one of the reasons why I run: because I don't want to let anybody down.

Another reason is because if I don't, I'll feel like shit. That's life isn't it. I find that the more I cave into my comforting instincts of "do it next time" or "5 more minutes", the shittier I feel. Then the shittier I feel, the more I want to treat myself with "5 more minutes" that poisoned me in the first place. I need to break that cycle and go eat shit. At least I'm tired but proud of myself at the end of my run. I remember someone saying: "movement is medicine" and I could not agree with it any more than I already do. Walks, runs, going to the gym, playing some catch on the field, this is peak happiness and all you need is yourself (maybe someone else if you're playing catch). Running makes me feel happy, even if it doesn't initially.

Last reason before I actually start figuring out how to actually code this blog to life, it's because it gives my life purpose. Why not run a marathon? I'm working to something that's hard to achieve, but it is achievable. Quite a lot of people run marathons, why not me? Majority of people haven't ran a marathon, yet they all had the potential to run one at some point in their lives. I don't want to fit in that group. I want to work on something that majority of people have never achieved. On top of balancing my daily life responsabilities, I could say that I balanced 3 jobs and trained for a marathon during the fall of 2024. Let's fucking go.

Well that's it for my first blog post. It didn't mean to be so long; it actually was going to be a "loren ipsum" type of blog before I decided it was my break activity. I'm super excited to have a blog cooking up. I love journaling and taking snapshots of moments in my life, whether through photos or writing. This is going to be a gamechanger and I can't wait to start. 

Until next time...

Richard
